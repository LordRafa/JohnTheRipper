John the Ripper CGMiner Integration

John the Ripper can check if there are running a CGMiner instance and pause to mine in those GPUs that are going to be used in a cracking session. When John the Ripper ends, the paused GPUs will start again to mine.

Furthermore you can set John the Ripper to start a new CGMiner Instance when the cracking session ends if there are not any other CGMiner instance.

Usage

Pause CGMiner GPUs

    You need to be sure that you start the CGMiner instance with the options:

    --api-listen --api-allow W:127.0.0.1/24 --api-port PORT

    Set the CGMiner API port in john.conf file:

    ...
    [Options:Miner]
    ...
    APIPort=PORT # PORT must be equal to CGMiner API port.
    ...

Start a CGMiner Instance After JtR Ends

    Set the option AfterEnd and AfterEndOptions in john.conf file.

    ...
    [Options:Miner]
    ...
    AfterEnd=1 # 1 - to enable Mine After End
               # 0 - to disable Mine After End
    AfterEndOptions= # CGMiner instance parameters.
    ...

The new CGMiner instance will be created with the parameters:

--api-listen --api-allow W:127.0.0.1/24
